<b>CHATBOT README:</b>

Meet Tosha the Learning app built using embed chain. Just enter any url and get answers to all your queries.

The chatbot in my code utilizes the embedchain library, and I'll explain how it functions and retrieves answers to user queries:

1.Initialization and API Key Setup:
At the beginning of your code, you set up your chatbot by creating an instance of OpenSourceApp. You also retrieve your OpenAI API key from a separate file (in a secure manner) and set it as an environment variable using os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"].

2.User Interaction:
My Streamlit app allows users to input a number of URL links and ask questions. These URLs are collected as input data, and the user's queries are processed by the chatbot.
Adding URLs to the Chatbot:
For each URL provided by the user, you add it to the chatbot instance using the zuck_bot.add("web_page", url) method. This step is essential as it allows the chatbot to access and reference these web pages when responding to user queries.

3.Conversation Chat Function:
When a user inputs a question, the conversation_chat(query) function is called with the user's question as the argument. The primary purpose of this function is to query the chatbot model and obtain a response.
Inside this function, zuck_bot.query(query) is called. This method processes the user's query using the embedchain library and leverages pre-trained models to generate responses.

4.Session State for Chat History:
You use Streamlit's st.session_state to maintain chat history, including the user's questions and the chatbot's responses. This history is stored in lists such as 'past' and 'generated' to keep track of the conversation.

5.Displaying the Chat Interface:
The display_chat_history() function manages the display of the chat interface. It sets up a Streamlit form where users can input questions and submit them. The user's input and chatbot responses are displayed in a chat-like format.

6.Querying and Response:
When a user submits a question, the conversation_chat function is invoked. It queries the chatbot by calling zuck_bot.query(query) with the user's question.
The chatbot uses the embedchain library, which likely leverages machine learning models and natural language processing techniques to understand and generate responses to user queries. The specifics of how the chatbot works internally depend on the architecture and model used in the embedchain library.
The response generated by the chatbot is returned and appended to the chat history.

7.Displaying Chat History:
The chat history is displayed within the Streamlit app. Both the user's questions and the chatbot's responses are shown in the reply_container using the message function. This provides a visually appealing and user-friendly chat interface.

In summary, the chatbot in your code integrates the embedchain library to understand and respond to user queries based on the provided URLs. The chatbot accesses and processes these URLs and generates responses using a combination of pre-trained models and natural language understanding techniques. The conversation history is tracked and displayed in a chat-like format using Streamlit components. The specifics of how the chatbot works under the hood are determined by the embedchain library and the models it employs.
